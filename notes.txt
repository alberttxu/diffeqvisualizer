Dear ImGui is rendering incorrectly on my Macbook Pro 2015 Retina 15-inch, but not on my external monitors.
Looks like high DPI is a common issue in other projects:
- https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/2816 (similar to what I'm seeing)
- https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#q-how-should-i-handle-dpi-in-my-application
- https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/3757

- https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/2956

Ideas I'm considering:
- dig around ImGui and/or raylib+glfw settings
   - pros: potentially faster to find existing solutions
   - cons: it's not very good for building a matrix editor
- write my own UI elements
   - pros: I need a custom UI anyways for complex eigenvalue/eigenvector input
      - Blender style drag-to-scale editing with an adaptive scaling rate for poorly conditioned matrices
      - complex number input editor
   - cons: takes more time
